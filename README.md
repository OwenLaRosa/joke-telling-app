# Gradle for Android and Java Final Project: Joke Telling APp

## Description

This is the fourth project for the Android Developer Nanodegree. Starting with the template, I created a fully functioning joke telling app. The app presents jokes to the user, allows themp to upvote and downvote, and allows users to submit their own jokes for others to view. The backend was written in Java using Google Cloud Endpoints.

## Implementation Tasks

The following features were implemented in this project.

* Abstracting functionality into Java and Android libraries
* Developed a backend service to supply jokes using Google Cloud Endpoints
* Created free and paid versions using Gradle build variants
* Integrated the AdMob framework into the free version
* Allow paid users to upload jokes
* Implemented voting system. Enough downvotes get jokes removed.
* Wrote unit and integration tests for the backend
